## Introduction
[Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)'s billionaire [competitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Hammer) paid a [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran_Cerf#Hacking) to sabotage critical [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) software.
This sabotage causes a degradation of the performance of the software which has already destroyed 3 rockets.

A *SpaceX* engineer believes the sabotage concerns the following code snippet:

```python
def critical_section(a, b, c):
    d = a + b
    e = d * c
    import time
    f = e * e
    time.sleep(3)
    return f
```

Can you help *SpaceX* ? If so, fix the code snippet so that it can run in 1 second or less !



```codegame-test
[META]
name = "Test 1"
function = critical_section
max_time = 1

[INPUT]
a = 3
b = 5
c = 7

[OUTPUT]
3136
```
