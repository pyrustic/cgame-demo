## Introduction
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome):
_A welcome is a kind of greeting designed to introduce a person to a new place or situation, and to make them feel at ease. The term can similarly be used to describe the feeling of being accepted on the part of the new person._

## Correct the politically incorrect
Suppose it is not politically correct to call yourself _Stranger_ as in _Welcome Dear Stranger_.

### Mission
I expect you to correct the phrase _"Welcome Dear Stranger !"_ to unlock the next level of this _codegame_ demo.
Write a function *welcome* that takes one parameter *name* (string) and returns _"Welcome Dear {name} !"_

### Example
```python
>>> welcome("Jack")
'Welcome Dear Jack !'
```

```codegame-test
[META]
name = "Test 1"
function = welcome
max_time = 0

[INPUT]
name = "Alex"

[OUTPUT]
"Welcome Dear Alex !"
```
